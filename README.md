I finally understood, why everyone favours react too much.
They favour it for reactivity. I always wondered that why people render with react and not with templating engines on the server.
I thought rendering with templating engines is far better than using react or similar things until I tried doing it the non-react way and making dom react with changes was harder.

I'll use react now!
